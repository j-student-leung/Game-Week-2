# Game-Week-2
Second weekly sprint of the game project
Objectives: Learn how to animate sprites by changing the playable character
Lessons learned: How to crop spritesheets, more familiarized with interactions between css and html
New questions/objectives: Currently, the monkeyking png is too large. How would I change the size of the sprite? Or conversely, how would I make the map bigger such that monkey king fits better into the world?
